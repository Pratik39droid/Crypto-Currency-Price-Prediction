# Crypto-Currency-Price-Prediction
This project aims to investigate the efficiency and application of machine learning algorithms, namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), for predicting the future price of cryptocurrencies. The study begins with a brief description of cryptocurrencies and the technology behind them, followed by an evaluation of traditional methodologies used in financial time series forecasting. Appropriate features are engineered from datasets and applied to machine learning algorithms to predict cryptocurrency prices. The historical cryptocurrency price data is preprocessed using normalization techniques to ensure consistent scaling across different cryptocurrencies. The data is then split into training and testing sets, with the testing set used to evaluate the performance of the models. Due to the volatility of cryptocurrencies, accurate price prediction is crucial. Researchers are employing various ML and DL algorithms to build models for improved accuracy, which requires exploring numerous models and can be time-consuming. LSTM and GRU, which are variants of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), are employed to capture the temporal dependencies in the cryptocurrency price data. These models have demonstrated promising results in various time series prediction tasks. The LSTM and GRU models are trained using the training data, and their hyperparameters are fine-tuned to optimize their performance. In addition to RNN-based models, the study utilizes ARIMA, a widely used statistical model for time series forecasting. ARIMA models capture autoregressive, moving average, and differencing components of the data. The prediction performance of the LSTM, GRU, and ARIMA models is evaluated on the testing data using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE). The prediction accuracy and  computational efficiency of the three models are compared. The experimental results demonstrate that LSTM and GRU models outperform ARIMA regarding prediction accuracy for cryptocurrency prices. While LSTM generally exhibits better performance due to its complexity, GRU shows promising  results with lower computational complexity, making it a suitable alternative when computational resources are limited. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of LSTM, GRU,and ARIMA models for cryptocurrency price prediction. The findings contribute to the development of accurate and efficient forecasting models, empowering investors and cryptocurrency enthusiasts to make informed decisions in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market.
